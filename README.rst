Fake Blender 2.79 Python API
=============================

Fake Blender 2.79 Python API for code completion, including all modules documented on API.
It's mainly focused on Blender Game Engine 2.7x and UPBGE 0.2.x use, so the game engine
modules have more accurate type hints than editor modules.

To use this API you just need a Python 3.x distribution and a text editor with advanced
code completion (PyCharm, Visual Studio Code with Python plugins, PyScripter, etc).

This project is based on nutti's fake-bpy-module_, however it's not auto-generated as the
former. It also includes some missing modules of the fake-bpy-module such as bge and id_prop,
and it aims to be more accurate in the data types.

Installation
-------------

Just type in the command line of your computer:

``pip install fake-blender-api-2.79``

And you're ready to take advantage of Blender code completion on your favorite text editor!
Just make sure you installed it on the same Python interpreter that your text is using.

Enjoy!
