## Functions

	Returns:	
	The description of the last error occurred in a bge.texture function.

	Return type:
	str"""

def imageToArray(image, mode):
	"""Returns a Buffer corresponding to the current image stored in a texture source object.

	Parameters:
	image - Image source object of type ...
	VideoFFmpeg
	ImageFFmpeg
	ImageBuff
	ImageMirror
	ImageMix
	ImageRender
	ImageViewport

	mode (str) - Optional argument representing the pixel format.
	You can use the characters R, G, B for the 3 color channels, A for the alpha channel, 0 to force a fixed 0 color channel and 1 to force a fixed 255 color channel.

	Examples:
	"BGR" will return 3 bytes per pixel with the Blue, Green and Red channels in that order.
	"RGB1" will return 4 bytes per pixel with the Red, Green, Blue channels in that order and the alpha channel forced to 255.

	A special mode "F" allows to return the image as an array of float. This mode should only be used to retrieve the depth buffer of the class:ImageViewport and ImageRender objects. The default mode is "RGBA".

	Returns:	
	An object representing the image as one dimensional array of bytes of size (pixel_size*width*height), line by line starting from the bottom of the image. The pixel size and format is determined by the mode parameter. For mode 'F', the array is a one dimensional array of float of size (width*height).

	Return type:
	Buffer"""

def materialID(object, name):
	"""Returns a numeric value that can be used in Texture to create a dynamic texture.

	The value corresponds to an internal material number that uses the texture identified by name. name is a string representing a texture name with IM prefix if you want to identify the texture directly. This method works for basic tex face and for material, provided the material has a texture channel using that particular texture in first position of the texture stack. name can also have MA prefix if you want to identify the texture by material. In that case the material must have a texture channel in first position.

	If the object has no material that matches name, it generates a runtime error. Use try/except to catch the exception.

	Ex: bge.texture.materialID(obj, 'IMvideo.png')

	Parameters:
	object (KX_GameObject) - The game object that uses the texture you want to make dynamic.
	name (str) - Name of the texture/material you want to make dynamic.

	Returns:	
	The internal material number.
